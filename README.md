Container for Python analysis codes regarding "Prediction of vascular ageing based on smartphoneacquired PPG signals"


the 3 code files at their first commit are tricky and messy, but they can give quite well the idea of what was performed during the analysis.

Comments can be helpful, but I know that the code is still far from being the clearest possible, for this reason feel free to email me at lorenzo.dallolio@studio.unibo.it for any question or comment.
